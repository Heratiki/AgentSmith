# User Workspace

This directory contains persistent user content created by AgentSmith. Unlike temporary execution files, content here is preserved across sessions.

## Directory Structure

- **`scripts/`** - User Python scripts that are automatically preserved when detected as user content
- **`files/`** - General user files created through file operations
- **`tools/`** - Confirmed working tools generated by the agent, saved in Python format
- **`data/`** - User data files and datasets
- **`temp/`** - Temporary files that get cleaned up (not persistent)

## How It Works

AgentSmith now distinguishes between:

1. **Temporary execution files** - Cleaned up after use
2. **User-generated content** - Automatically preserved based on content analysis

### User Content Detection

Scripts are preserved if they contain indicators like:
- Function or class definitions (`def`, `class`)
- User comments (`# User`, `# Script`)
- Substantial code (>5 lines with meaningful content)
- File creation operations

### Tool Persistence

When AgentSmith creates custom tools that pass validation:
- Tool implementation is saved to `tools/` directory
- Includes documentation and metadata
- Available for future sessions

## Usage

The workspace is automatically managed by AgentSmith's sandbox system. User content is preserved while maintaining security and isolation from the project's core files.
